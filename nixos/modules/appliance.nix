# nixos/modules/appliance.nix
#
# Appliance specifics layered on top of modules/palmux.nix:
#   - immutable image + mutable state on a separate /persist volume
#   - the OPERATOR DROP-IN extensibility hook (see docs/nixos-appliance-design.md §2.2)
#   - generation-based upgrades
#
# The operator extends the appliance by dropping *.nix fragments into the flake's
# ./local/ dir (which lives on /persist) and running `nixos-rebuild switch`. The
# import is flake-PURE because ./local is part of the on-appliance flake's source
# tree (examples/onappliance-flake/), not an out-of-tree /etc read.
#
# NOTE: scaffold — not yet eval-checked. TODO(stageN) markers per the design doc.

  # yet; the palmux service (stateDir under /persist) just runs degraded until it is.

  # ── login / access — NEVER bake an author/operator key into the image ──────
  # SECURITY: a distributed appliance image MUST ship with ZERO baked SSH keys /
  # passwords. Baking the author's pubkey here would be a backdoor into every
  # deployed PalmuxOS. Access is provisioned by the DEPLOYER at first boot:
  #   1. cloud-init (primary, Proxmox-native): the deployer attaches their own
  #      SSH pubkey via the platform's cloud-init drive → injected on first boot.
  #   2. palmux first-boot onboarding/claim (web): the operator claims the
  #      instance (password / SSO secret / optional key) before anything is
  #      exposed (extends the Sa53137 onboarding wizard).
  #   3. source/flake users put THEIR OWN key in THEIR OWN flake (examples/user-flake).
  # The operator's own key is later layered via /etc/palmux/local/*.nix — AFTER
  # they have claimed access. This module deliberately sets NO authorizedKeys.
  services.openssh.enable = lib.mkDefault true;
  services.openssh.settings.PasswordAuthentication = lib.mkDefault false;
  services.cloud-init.enable = lib.mkDefault true; # first-boot key/user injection from the platform

  # This module sets NO authorizedKeys — that is the whole point. The deployer's
  # key is provisioned at first boot (cloud-init / onboarding) or layered in their
  # own /etc/palmux/local AFTER claiming. So a deployed+customized appliance WILL
  # have the deployer's key; the *distributed image build* must not. That "no
  # baked keys in the shipped artifact" invariant is enforced by an image-build CI
  # check (grep the built image's authorized_keys), NOT by an eval assertion —
  # an assertion can't tell the shipped-image build from an operator's rebuild and
  # would wrongly break legitimate operator customization. TODO(stage3): add the
  # image-build no-baked-keys CI check.

  # NOTE: the OPERATOR DROP-IN import is wired in the ON-APPLIANCE flake
  # (examples/onappliance-flake/flake.nix), which does:
  #     imports = [ palmux.nixosModules.appliance ]
  #            ++ lib.filesystem.listFilesRecursive ./local;
  # so fragments in /persist/palmux/nixos-local (symlinked as the flake's ./local)
  # are merged with full NixOS surface + override palmux's mkDefaults.
